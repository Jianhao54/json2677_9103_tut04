**Painting with Circle Noise-Fork by Jordan Torres from Openprocessing**

The reason why I chose this inspiration because I'm planning to choose 'The Scream' by Edvard Munch from the artworks. The example is starting from many small particles and slowly transfroming into curved and colored lines, finally form a circle. The entire animation has four stages, each change starts from the previous end position. This shares similar feature when I looked closer into 'The Scream' artwork, it also has a lot of curved shapes and combined of different colored lines. This draws my attention to interpret it in geometric patterns and how to make the curved lines animated in the groupwork task.
